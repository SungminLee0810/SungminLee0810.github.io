I received my B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, in 2012, and my Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 2018. I am a research scientist at the Corporate R&D Center, SK Telecom, Korea. My current research interests include machine learning, computer vision, biomedical image processing and weakly supervised learning.

I also serve as a reviewer of various machine learning conferences (CVPR2020, ACCV2020, WACV2021).
